  <p>Welcome to Create Cupcakes, established 2020 by founder and owner Gen Torelle. Gen's vision is to provide a new take on cupcakes. Here at Create Cupcakes, we offer an array of the finest cupcakes in Portland, OR. From our prize winning sweet buttercream peach cupcake to our savory cornbread and bacon cupcake, we strive to give your tastebuds an inspirational experience. Our goal is to provide the tastiest treats for any occasion.</p>

  <p>At cupcakes, there are a few ways to order. If you're interested in our catering (parties of 50+) please send us a little blurb about your party/event, what your vision for the cupcakes looks like (and tastes like), and if there are any dietary restrictions. From there, one of our amazing cupcakers will be in touch with a special menu, customized just for you! Of course, if you have something specific in mind please let us know and we'll hold off on the special menu.</p>

  <p>In addition to custom catering, we also have a storefront where you can purchase bundles of cupcakes or single cupcakes to build a variety pack! We highly suggest staying for at least one dozen, so you can try out a handful from our 100 different flavors, but we'll happily serve at amount to anyone!</p>

  <p>The last thing we want to stress at Create Cupcakes is the gift of giving. For every cupcake purchased we donate $1 to the local soup kitchen. We also recreate our variety of cupcakes every week, and all leftover cupcakes are donated as well. We believe everyone deserves a little treat!</p>

  <p>For inquiries, feel free to <a href="mailto:customerservice@test.com" class="flashy">email us!</a></p>
